Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for
the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-
holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from

three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who
settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform. The
